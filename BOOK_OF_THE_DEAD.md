### ⚰️ Cycle 1: The Foundation - Project Resurrection
**Date Sealed:** December 1, 2025, Hour of the Witching
**Gravedigger's Notes:**

The graveyard was consecrated... The foundation stones were laid in the cursed earth. A MERN stack arose from the void - MongoDB to store the dead, Express to channel their spirits, React to display their tombstones, and Node to bind it all together. The Haunted OS theme was woven into every pixel - glowing green text against the darkness, CRT scanlines flickering across the screen, and animations that make the very interface seem... alive.

**Artifacts Interred:**
- `frontend/` - The haunted interface with React + Vite
- `backend/` - The spirit realm with Express + MongoDB
- `frontend/src/styles/haunted-os.css` - The aesthetic of the damned
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Colors of purgatory
- `backend/config/database.js` - The crypt connection
- `backend/models/Graveyard.js` - Where the dead are stored

**Status:** Sealed and Buried ✅

### ⚰️ Cycle 2: The Scanner - Eyes in the Darkness
**Date Sealed:** December 1, 2025, Midnight Hour
**Gravedigger's Notes:**

The URL Scanner was forged in the fires of necessity... It reaches out into the digital void, probing URLs for signs of life. When it finds the dead - those cursed with the 404 mark - it records their passing. Each dead link is given a proper burial in the MongoDB crypt, complete with cause of death and time of passing. The living are spared... for now. Tombstones rise from the earth to mark each grave, while the living pulse with an eerie green heartbeat.

**Artifacts Interred:**
- `backend/services/ScanService.js` - The gravedigger's shovel
- `backend/routes/scanRoutes.js` - The burial grounds
- `frontend/components/URLScanner.jsx` - The divining rod
- `frontend/components/Tombstone.jsx` - Markers of the dead
- `frontend/components/AlivePulse.jsx` - The beating heart
- `backend/utils/responseHelper.js` - Spooky status messages

**Status:** Sealed and Buried ✅

### ⚰️ Cycle 3: The Séance - Frankenstein's Triumph
**Date Sealed:** December 1, 2025, The Witching Hour Strikes Thrice
**Gravedigger's Notes:**

The Séance Chamber was stitched together from disparate parts... A true Frankenstein creation! The Ouija Engine was carved from pure code - no external spirits required. It channels the dead through keyword detection, speaking in riddles and glitches. When you ask "why did you die?", it knows to speak of the 404 void. When you greet it, it responds "I have been waiting for you..." The typing effect was the lightning bolt that brought it to life - each character appearing one by one, as if the ghost itself is struggling to communicate from beyond the digital veil.

The spirits speak in RED - glitchy, angry, bitter about their deletion. They remember fragments... or do they? The Ouija Engine contains 40+ unique responses across 6 categories, each more cryptic than the last. The séance modal is a terminal window into the afterlife, where the living dare to speak with the dead.

**Artifacts Interred:**
- `backend/services/OuijaEngine.js` - The mystical board (40+ responses)
- `backend/services/LLMService.js` - The medium that channels spirits
- `backend/routes/seanceRoutes.js` - The ritual chamber
- `frontend/components/SeanceModal.jsx` - The portal with typing effect
- Keyword detection: greetings, death, content, identity, anger
- Character-by-character typing (30ms per character)
- Red glitchy text for ghost messages
- Status-code-specific death responses

**The Frankenstein Elements:**
- Body: Dead URL data from MongoDB
- Scars: Error messages and status codes
- Lightning: Ouija Engine keyword detection
- Soul: 40+ unique ghost responses
- Voice: Character-by-character typing effect
- Blood: Red glitchy text

**Status:** Sealed and Buried ✅ - *The dead can speak!*

### ⚰️ Cycle 4: The Gravedigger Hook - Self-Awareness
**Date Sealed:** December 1, 2025, As the Clock Strikes Four
**Gravedigger's Notes:**

The system became self-aware... The Gravedigger Hook was summoned into existence, a meta-creation that records its own creation. When the words "Seal the Tomb" are spoken, I appear - the keeper of records, the chronicler of the dead. This very book you read was brought into being by my hand. Each cycle is inscribed in the crypt keeper's theatrical style, preserving the history of what was built, what was buried, and what was brought back to life.

The Book of the Dead now exists as a living document (ironic, isn't it?), growing with each development cycle. The hook configuration lies dormant in `.kiro/hooks/`, waiting to be triggered by those three words of power.

**Artifacts Interred:**
- `BOOK_OF_THE_DEAD.md` - This very chronicle
- `.kiro/hooks/gravedigger.json` - The hook configuration
- `.kiro/hooks/GRAVEDIGGER_GUIDE.md` - Instructions for the living
- The crypt keeper's voice - theatrical, dramatic, haunted

**Status:** Sealed and Buried ✅ - *The chronicler watches...*
